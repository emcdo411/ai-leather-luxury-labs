## 🧠 AI & Data Science Use Cases

### 🔍 1. Leather Quality Grading

* Deep learning models (e.g., `YOLOv8`, `OpenCV`) identify blemishes, scars, and defects pre-cutting
* Vision systems optimize yield per hide

### 📦 2. Supply Chain Transparency

* Blockchain + AI to verify ethical sourcing and track hides from farm to factory
* Used extensively in Brazil to avoid cattle from deforested Amazon regions

### 🖌️ 3. Design Personalization

* AI-powered configurators with 3D rendering (e.g., `Three.js`, `TwinOne`)
* Scanning customer anatomy for bespoke footwear, saddles, and seats

### 🏭 4. Predictive Maintenance

* IoT sensors with ML models (e.g., `prophet`, `xgboost`) to reduce downtime in dyeing/stitching equipment

### 🧬 5. Trend Forecasting

* NLP-driven market and social media analysis to predict color/material trends 6–12 months in advance

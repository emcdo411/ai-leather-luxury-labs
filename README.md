## 🌍 Industry Focus

* **Italy**: Tuscan tanneries and footwear hubs (e.g., Florence, Milan, Marche)
* **Spain**: Leathercraft regions like Ubrique and Salamanca (noted for saddlery)
* **Brazil**: Franca and São Paulo—a hub for shoes and leather car interiors

Key Products:

* 🇮🇹 Handmade shoes (e.g., Berluti, Santoni)
* 🇪🇸 Designer saddles (e.g., Zaldi, Marjoman)
* 🇧🇷 Luxury car seats (e.g., used in global OEMs like Audi, Mercedes)

---

## 🧠 AI & Data Science Use Cases

### 🔍 1. Leather Quality Grading

* Deep learning models (e.g., `YOLOv8`, `OpenCV`) identify blemishes, scars, and defects pre-cutting
* Vision systems optimize yield per hide

### 📦 2. Supply Chain Transparency

* Blockchain + AI to verify ethical sourcing and track hides from farm to factory
* Used extensively in Brazil to avoid cattle from deforested Amazon regions

### 🖌️ 3. Design Personalization

* AI-powered configurators with 3D rendering (e.g., `Three.js`, `TwinOne`)
* Scanning customer anatomy for bespoke footwear, saddles, and seats

### 🏭 4. Predictive Maintenance

* IoT sensors with ML models (e.g., `prophet`, `xgboost`) to reduce downtime in dyeing/stitching equipment

### 🧬 5. Trend Forecasting

* NLP-driven market and social media analysis to predict color/material trends 6–12 months in advance
